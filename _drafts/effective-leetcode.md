# Effective LeetCode

## TODO

- [ ] Clean up script and post on GitHub.
- [ ] Write in Scrivener or Ulysses.
- [ ] Do analysis again - take questions that give top 80% of each tag, instead of grouping by tag. Expect a breadth of questions. Inspect both lists and explain why one is better than another.

## Introduction

Interviewing is something you'll be doing a bunch of times in your life.
Link about optimizing pay by moving every 2 years. You will do many interviews each time you do this. It makes sense to have a good approach to it.

Thankfully, there is a ton of meta-learning material, and tools available since last time I blogged about interviewing. -- Actually, just reference this in the soft skills section. Or better yet...

Should focus on the material you will actually use.

Image of learning curve.

Interviewing is inherently competitive. Famously, it takes 10k hours to be world-class. But you probably don't need to be world-class to get a good job, just better than most people. 20 hours marked on curve, 10000 hours marked on curve.
(try find picture of this to see where this point of diminishing returns is).

Note that there are ways to help it be less competitive. For example - don't apply to jobs through LinkedIn, or anything that makes it too easy to apply. There will be a glut.

%% Note that this applies to dating too.

Metalearning - if I were to cut down a tree in an hour, I'd spend 50 minutes sharpening my axe.

Outline:
- This post focuses on the deconstruction and selection part of metalearning.

Future posts:
- Systems and patterns for answering algorithm questions
- How to spend less time preparing for your next job hunt
    - If you want to optimize (programmer with hat - swizec) you should consider finding a new job every 2 years
        - 4 years is common too.
    - Average age of new grad, until retirement - how many jobs?
        - 65 - 23 = 42 years, or somewhere between 10 and 20 times?

## The Anatomy of the Interview Loop

- Behavioural, work history, etc
    - As well as the way you answer the algorithm questions
- Your typical algorithm questions
    - There is a behavioural aspect to this too - how do you communicate, how methodical is your approach? Are you able to stay cool and charming?
- Design questions (open ended)
- We spend more time on the algorithm interviews, as there are usually more of those compared to the others.
- Thankfully, these are also the easiest part to prepare for, because they are fairly formulaic after you have some basics down.

## Analysis

- If you spend 5 minutes on Blind (and I'm not sure you'd want to spend much more time on there), LeetCode is very clearly the main place people practice questions now.
- Something that sets it apart is that it has some representation of frequency, which can be broken down by company, etc.
- They also have tags that show us the high level category of solution.
- For this analysis, let's assume that we want to be prepared to interview for any company (since getting multiple offers is a great way to give you leverage for negotiation - more on that later)
- Using this, we can work out the priority of each solution.
- Pareto analysis.
- Complement it with Interviewing.io playbacks?
