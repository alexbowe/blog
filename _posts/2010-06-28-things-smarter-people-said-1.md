<p>I am currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/alexbowecom-20">Code Complete 2</a> as per Jeff Atwood's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/recommended-reading-for-developers.html">Recommended Reading for Developers</a> list, where I came across this interesting quote by Glenford Myers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We try to solve the problem by rushing through the design process so that enough time is left at the end of the project to uncover the errors that were  made because we rushed through the design process"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it succinctly illustrates the need for balance in software design; it is  just vague enough to communicate exactly what you need to hear.</p>
<p>I'm interested in hearing any other cool quotes, or book recommendations if  you've got some =]</p>
